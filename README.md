## Local project setup
1. Install LÖVE (https://love2d.org/)
2. Add your LÖVE installation directory to your PATH environment variable
3. Open this repository in VSCode and install the recommended extensions
4. You should now be able to press F5 to start the game with debugging support

If you see `"love" is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."`, that means it is not able to find the LÖVE executable through your PATH environment variable. Try restarting VSCode to refresh your environment variables. If that doesn't work, ensure your PATH environment variable contains the correct directory.
